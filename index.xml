      <description>Jeff Schneider has some excellent instructive content on YouTube, and takes the time to explain some of the theory behind the music. Here, he plays a lush neo-soul chord progression, walks us through a nice tritone substitution and shows how we can use secondary dominants to introduce chords from outside the key.
    Here&amp;#8217;s a transcription, made much easier than usual thanks to Jeff&amp;#8217;s animated keyboard.

      <description>Some software I&amp;#8217;ve written and released as open-source:
   The Iconic Memory Game (source)&amp;#8201;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8201;a memory game based on the tachistoscope experiments by George Sperling in the 1960s which sought to characterise the visual short-term memory system. Implemented in Elm.
  Blinkenwords (source)&amp;#8201;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8201;a minimalist rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) reading utility. Implemented in Elm.
  Gluap&amp;#8201;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8201;a stalled implementation of the PushGP stack-based genetic programming framework. Implemented in Lua.</description>

      <description>There&amp;#8217;s a really nice sequence of jazzy chords in Paul Barton&amp;#8217;s YouTube video &#34;Piano Sounds Never Heard Before!&#34; at the 7:44 mark:
    I really liked the chord progression and tried to transcribe it. You can find it here.
