The video made some great points, but I was a bit disappointed that it ended on a sort of &#34;there’s not much we can do, oh well&#34; note, and wrote the following comment which I’d like to repeat here:

Another manifestation of this that should really be illegal at this point, is purposely non-repairable electronics. With each generation of games console, companies like Nintendo and Sony have added more and more ways for the devices to become permanently bricked: SSD card or BIOS chip fails? It had an encryption key that was irreparably linked to other chips in the system, so the device is now e-waste.
John Deere was central in the fight against their own customers' right to repair their tractors, and went so far as to claim that farmers don’t actually own the tractors they’ve bought — instead, they own "an implied license for the life of the vehicle to operate the vehicle". The list goes on, but the more we talk about it and fight back, the better our chances.</p></div></blockquote></div><hr class=footer-separator><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li class=tag-li><a href=/tags/tech>tech</a></li><li class=tag-li><a href=/tags/consumer-rights>consumer rights</a></li><li class=tag-li><a href=/tags/shitflation>shitflation</a></li></ul></div><div class=back><a href=https://overto.eu/><span aria-hidden=true>← Back</span></a></div><div class=back></div></div></div><section class=section><script src=https://utteranc.es/client.js repo=DestyNova/overto.eu issue-term=pathname label=comment theme=gruvbox-dark crossorigin=anonymous async></script></section><div class="footer wrapper"><nav class=nav><div>2025</div></nav></div></body></html>
