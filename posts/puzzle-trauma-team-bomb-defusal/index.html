This is obviously not good enough, but then exploring the scene in the game reveals another crucial clue: the only digits used in the disarming code are 1, 2 and 3. This small refinement immediately reduces the number of solutions to 1. Here’s the code:</p></div><div class=listingblock><div class=content><pre class=highlight><code class=language-picat data-lang=picat>% Benchmark 1: picat trauma_team.pi

import cp.

main =&gt;
  Nums = [A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H],   % 8 digits
  Nums :: 1..3,               % only digits 1, 2 and 3 are used

  Sols = solve_all([], Nums), % what are they?
  Sols.len = 1,               % there should only be one solution
