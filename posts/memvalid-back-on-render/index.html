The only downside is that the language’s development and community appears to be dead.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>Anyway, at some point I produced a <a href=https://github.com/DestyNova/urweb-docker>Docker image</a> and used it to deploy Memvalid on Heroku’s free tier. Sadly this tier went away about two years ago, and the app was deleted.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>Today, I decided to redeploy it on <a href=https://render.com>Render</a>. I was a bit confused about how to it, but it turns out if you write a <code>Dockerfile</code> with an entrypoint that starts your program, that’s enough. The only bit that caught me out was its automatic port scan to discover what port your service is running on: it uses HEAD requests, which Ur/web doesn’t support (it’s really designed to run behind something like Lighttpd or Nginx). But it turns out that Render’s default port for web applications is 10000, and if you launch the app on this port, the portscan is unnecessary and the deployment works fine.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>The app is now up and running <a href=https://memvalid.overto.eu>here</a>, although it’s on the free tier and gets put to sleep when requests stop for a while.</p></div><hr class=footer-separator><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li class=tag-li><a href=/tags/tech>tech</a></li><li class=tag-li><a href=/tags/programming>programming</a></li></ul></div><div class=back><a href=https://overto.eu/><span aria-hidden=true>← Back</span></a></div><div class=back></div></div></div><section class=section><script src=https://utteranc.es/client.js repo=DestyNova/overto.eu issue-term=pathname label=comment theme=gruvbox-dark crossorigin=anonymous async></script></section><div class="footer wrapper"><nav class=nav><div>2024</div></nav></div></body></html>
