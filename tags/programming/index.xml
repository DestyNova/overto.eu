It’s much easier and less action-oriented than the previous games — New Blood and Second Opinion, and more of a visual novel game for the most part, where the previous games involved quite difficult action-puzzling and strategy in real time.
There’s a section of the game where a series of bombs are placed, with puzzle hints left behind for disarming each bomb.</description></item><item><title>Nim: Outdated nimble.ini</title><link>https://overto.eu/posts/nimble-outdated-ini/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Aug 2023 19:28:22 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://overto.eu/posts/nimble-outdated-ini/</guid><description>I was interested today in trying to write a simple GUI program using Nim’s [nimx] library. But even with the latest Nim (2.0.0) and Nimble (0.14.2), I ran into this:
Reading official package list nimble.nim(683) getDownloadInfo Error: Package darwin@any version not found. This was confusing. I opened an issue on the nimx repo and the author pointed out that the darwin package is listed here, although I didn’t see it in this list.</description></item></channel></rss>
