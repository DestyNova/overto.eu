Rather than just stepping into the firehose of what the latest &amp;#34;Big Tech&amp;#34; recommender systems want to show me, it’s me deciding who I want to hear more from.
These days I use RSSGuard, a very simple and lightweight reader for RSS/ATOM/JSON feeds.</description></item><item><title>How I started programming</title><link>https://overto.eu/posts/how-i-started-programming/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Apr 2024 10:40:44 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://overto.eu/posts/how-i-started-programming/</guid><description>My parents got me a Commodore 64 really late in its lifespan, maybe around 1990. Although the machine felt almost magical when loading games from cassette tape, the user’s manual called out to me almost immediately. C64 BASIC was pretty poor compared to dialects on other machines, and certainly compared to older languages like Lisp and Forth. But I didn’t know about them, nor even that there was anything else, until an uncle bought me a copy of Choosing and Using Your Home Computer by Orbis.</description></item><item><title>Puzzle: Trauma Team bomb defusal #2</title><link>https://overto.eu/posts/puzzle-trauma-team-bomb-defusal/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Dec 2023 23:10:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://overto.eu/posts/puzzle-trauma-team-bomb-defusal/</guid><description>One of my kids has gotten into the old Nintendo Wii game Trauma Team, part of the Trauma Center series by Atlus. It’s much easier and less action-oriented than the previous games — New Blood and Second Opinion, and more of a visual novel game for the most part, where the previous games involved quite difficult action-puzzling and strategy in real time.
There’s a section of the game where a series of bombs are placed, with puzzle hints left behind for disarming each bomb.</description></item><item><title>Nim: Outdated nimble.ini</title><link>https://overto.eu/posts/nimble-outdated-ini/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Aug 2023 19:28:22 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://overto.eu/posts/nimble-outdated-ini/</guid><description>I was interested today in trying to write a simple GUI program using Nim’s [nimx] library. But even with the latest Nim (2.0.0) and Nimble (0.14.2), I ran into this:
Reading official package list nimble.nim(683) getDownloadInfo Error: Package darwin@any version not found. This was confusing. I opened an issue on the nimx repo and the author pointed out that the darwin package is listed here, although I didn’t see it in this list.</description></item></channel></rss>
