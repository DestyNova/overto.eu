It’s much easier and less action-oriented than the previous games — New Blood and Second Opinion, and more of a visual novel game for the most part, where the previous games involved quite difficult action-puzzling and strategy in real time.
There’s a section of the game where a series of bombs are placed, with puzzle hints left behind for disarming each bomb.</description></item></channel></rss>
