It was surprisingly cheap for what it offered, and after it went out of stock I tried to find another but it was either unobtainable or the price had gone way up.
Anyway, eventually I decided more RAM would be nice, since I was starting to hammer the SSD as swap.</description></item><item><title>Playing Revenant using Wine and Proton</title><link>https://overto.eu/posts/revenant-wine-proton/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 May 2021 02:11:51 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://overto.eu/posts/revenant-wine-proton/</guid><description>TL;DR: I tried to run an old game called Revenant on Linux using both WINE and Proton, but both had problems.

Background The WINE project is an emulation layer that enables you to run a large amount of Windows programs on a Unix system. It can be difficult to configure, but it’s a fairly mature project that even supports some modern Windows games.</description></item><item><title>Living with dwm</title><link>https://overto.eu/posts/dwm-extras/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Apr 2020 17:19:11 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://overto.eu/posts/dwm-extras/</guid><description>You may have heard of tiling window managers like dwm or i3. These are pretty interesting from a nerdy elitist hacker perspective (&amp;#34;I know Unix!&amp;#34;), but can also look quite nice and make good use of on-screen space. I switched to dwm yesterday and enjoyed spending some time to figure out the absolute basics. On my old, small laptop though, I realised that it suits me best to just have a separate tag per application.</description></item></channel></rss>
