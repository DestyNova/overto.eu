Although the machine felt almost magical when loading games from cassette tape, the user’s manual called out to me almost immediately. C64 BASIC was pretty poor compared to dialects on other machines, and certainly compared to older languages like Lisp and Forth. But I didn’t know about them, nor even that there was anything else, until an uncle bought me a copy of Choosing and Using Your Home Computer by Orbis.</description></item></channel></rss>
