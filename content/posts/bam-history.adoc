A few years ago I took this photo on Barrow Street near Ringsend, Dublin. BAM were tearing down some of the old https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boland%27s_Mill[Boland's Mill] site to make way for yet more shiny fancy corporate buildings. To be fair, they did repair some of the protected buildings which are part of the city's heritage.

The graffiti quote is a pleasing reference to the catchphrase heard at the end of obnoxious "Cillit Bang" ads that used to run on UK and Irish TV:
