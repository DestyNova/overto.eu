Jeff Schneider has some excellent instructive content on YouTube, and takes the time to explain some of the theory behind the music. Here, he plays a lush neo-soul chord progression and walks us through a nice tritone substitution and shows how we can use secondary dominants to introduce chords from outside the key.

Here's a link:/Schneider_RnB_chords.pdf[transcription], made much easier than usual thanks to Jeff's animated keyboard.
