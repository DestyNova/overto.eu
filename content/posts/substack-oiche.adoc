I've been unemployed for over a year now, which has given me extra time to do various things. While I mostly write (extremely sporadically) about technical things that catch my fancy, I recently started a Substack publication called https://oiche.substack.com[Scéalta na hOiche] (Irish for "stories of the night").

I post there (sporadically...) with silly bedtime stories I make up with my youngest kid. Feel free to check it out in case that's your cup of tea!
