While working on my first hobby gamedev project with Defold, I ran into an issue when trying to install the debug APK on my Android phone:

> There was a problem parsing the package.

Searching the Defold forums and the web didn't produce anything obviously relevant, so I looked at the sample project and tried to figure out what was different in the project settings. Most of the configuration was the same (that is to say, default), so I tried looking at the contents of the APK with `unzip -l`. Yes, an APK is just a zipfile that seems to follow JAR conventions.

Inside the APK, I noticed a file named `lib/arm64-v8a/libpitch_instinct.so`. But the example project's APK had `lib/arm64-v8a/libColorslidetutorial.so`. Surely it wouldn't just be that an underscore is verboten there?

That filename is derived from the project title (with spaces and some other chars stripped), defined in the file `game.project`. I tried renaming mine from `pitch_instinct` to `Pitch instinct` and lo and behold, the APK installs on my phone without issue.

Now, I don't know if it's literally that library file within the APK that's the problem -- more likely I'd guess that it's something in one of the 3 different manifest files: `AndroidManifest.xml`, `assets/game.dmanifest` and `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF`.

Hope this might help you in your journeys.
