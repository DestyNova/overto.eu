Some software I've written and released as open-source:

* https://iconic.overto.eu[The Iconic Memory Game] (https://github.com/DestyNova/iconic-memory-game[source]) -- a memory game based on the tachistoscope experiments by George Sperling in the 1960s which sought to characterise the visual short-term memory system. Implemented in https://elm-lang.org[Elm].
* https://bw.overto.eu[Blinkenwords] (https://github.com/DestyNova/blinkenwords-elm[source]) -- a minimalist rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) reading utility. Implemented in https://elm-lang.org[Elm].
