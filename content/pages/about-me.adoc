Howye! I'm Ois√≠n, a programmer and musician living in Dublin, Ireland. Here's a few of the things I'm into and may occasionally write something about here:

* Programming in a link:{{< ref "/content/pages/languages.adoc" >}}[bajillion different languages], for fun and (once upon a time) profit
* Music in many flavours, from jazz to traditional Irish tunes and old computer game soundtracks. From time to time I'll post transcriptions of music that catches my fancy.
* Complaining about things.
* Projects I'm working on.
