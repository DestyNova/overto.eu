Some software I've written and released as open-source:

* https://github.com/DestyNova/nimplication[Nimplication] -- a toy [SAT solver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAT_solver) using the [DPLL algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPLL_algorithm) (and maybe [CDCL](https://cse442-17f.github.io/Conflict-Driven-Clause-Learning) in future).
* https://fun.overto.eu/metron[Metron] (https://github.com/DestyNova/fun/tree/main/docs/metron[source]) -- a minimal implementation of a metronome that allows you to only play the first of every _n_ beats. Uses the HTML5 webaudio API to play clicks.
* https://pitcher.overto.eu[Pitcher] (https://github.com/DestyNova/pitcher[source]) -- a collection of exercises for training and testing absolute pitch (also known as perfect pitch). I trained with it for a while and didn't make much progress, and took part in a research study in training absolute pitch via another method which was much more effective. But I still use the pitch test from time to time to check how reliable my sense of pitch is (my mean absolute error is usually around 0.2-0.5 semitones). Implemented in https://elm-lang.org[Elm] and uses the HTML5 webaudio API to control sounds.
* https://shotclock.overto.eu[Shotclock] (https://github.com/DestyNova/shotclock[source]) -- a shot clock for snooker shootout games. Implemented in https://elm-lang.org[Elm] and uses the HTML5 webaudio API to control sounds.
* https://iconic.overto.eu[The Iconic Memory Game] (https://github.com/DestyNova/iconic-memory-game[source]) -- a memory game based on the tachistoscope experiments by George Sperling in the 1960s which sought to characterise the visual short-term memory system. Implemented in https://elm-lang.org[Elm].
* https://bw.overto.eu[Blinkenwords] (https://github.com/DestyNova/blinkenwords-elm[source]) -- a minimalist rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) reading utility. Implemented in https://elm-lang.org[Elm].
* https://github.com/DestyNova/Gluap[Gluap] -- a stalled implementation of the PushGP stack-based genetic programming framework. Implemented in https://www.lua.org/[Lua].
