<p>This is a very well-written book. But I found it hard to make progress quickly because some of the exercises were quite difficult and I felt compelled to complete them before moving on, although I think the author specifically advises to not get stuck on them and just move on if need be.</p>

<p>These were really nice and simple. Each exercise had a small, understandable scope and most were simple enough that I didn&#8217;t get stuck. Each set of exercises was in a separate directory, numbered from 01 to 21, and running the test suite generally took a second or less, so I used a script to automatically call <code>dune runtest</code> whenever I saved changes to that exercise&#8217;s <code>problem.ml</code> file. I wish more tutorials were written with this emphasis on manageable exercises and an easy UX. I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;ll continue with the next sections which involve games and bigger projects, but we&#8217;ll see.</p>

<p>This was fun and easy, perhaps as a byproduct of Go being quite a simple language. Unlike Rust and Haskell which require a lot of discussion about abstract concepts (and exercises to discover that you still didn&#8217;t get it), Go&#8217;s simplicity means you spend more time focusing on more immediately practical topics. I was surprised to note some strange idiosyncrasies with Go and its standard lib, though&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;for example, when parsing a date, you need to provide a sample date in the desired format&#8230;&#8203; the sample date needs to be a very specific reference date: <code>Mon Jan 2 15:04:05 MST 2006</code> (i.e. day of week 0, month 1, day 2, hour 3, minute 4, second 5, year (200)6&#8230;&#8203; MST is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_Time_Zone">Mountain Standard Time</a> which I assume was the time zone where one of the language authors lived). If you supply a different date, then times that you parse might <em>silently</em> be parsed into incorrect timestamps. Weird. Still, the tutorial was refreshing and I managed to glide through over several days, spending maybe 30 minutes a day.</p>

<p>Another well-written and surprisingly concise tutorial. I didn&#8217;t know much about refinement types (or automated proof checking in general) so expected this to be heavy on mathematical foundations. I&#8217;m on chapter 6 now and there&#8217;s been none of that&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;it&#8217;s remarkably practical and usable right from the beginning, and I&#8217;m quite excited about using it in real projects (despite my poor knowledge of Haskell). One problem so far is that some of the samples and exercises can&#8217;t be compiled for various reasons, so I&#8217;ve had to open a couple of issues on the Github repo to get help. Luckily, the authors have been very helpful and responsive, so I have no doubt this will improve in future.</p>
