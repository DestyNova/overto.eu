      <description>Experiences with tutorials, books or courses I’ve taken in recent times.

      <description>Some software I’ve written and released as open-source:
Metron (source) — a minimal implementation of a metronome that allows you to only play the first of every n beats. Uses the HTML5 webaudio API to play clicks.
Pitcher (source) — a collection of exercises for training and testing absolute pitch (also known as perfect pitch). I’ve been training with it for a while and still don’t have perfect pitch, but maybe I’ll update this if that changes.</description>
