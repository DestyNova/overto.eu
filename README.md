# What's all this then?

A static site, built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), where I might occasionally write blog posts and add links to things I've built.

It's hosted with Github Pages, and uses the very handy [Utterances](https://utteranc.es) app to enable commenting through the backchannel of Github issues.
